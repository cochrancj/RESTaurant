<h1>Welcome Back %= @server.username % </h1>


WHY IS THIS NOT WORKING? - ADDING SIMPLE


<div class="orders">

<h1>CREATE NEW ORDER</h1>

<p>in theory, I should be able to create a table here like the one that is on my new customer page - only as the Orders table stands, I only have: server id, menu_item id, and customer_id.</p>

<p>Need to add a column for menu item???</p>

<p>If I do that, will I no longer need the menu item table?</p>

<p>If I go down that route, how will i handle the food editing, etc. for the admins?</p>

</div>
