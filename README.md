#User Story

I'm Sally the waitress. As a server, I need to be able to fire this app up on my work phone -
  - And be able to:
      - Log in
      - Create a new order
      - Enter the item(s) each customer wants
      - View the order, which lists the customer(s), table number, what each customer ordered, and whether they have paid or not

  - I also need to be able to submit my order to the kitchen, edit my order, and mark the order as paid when all customers have paid. 
  
#NEXT STEPS

#V1.5
  I need to fix it so the changes I made after deploying to Heroku show up in this repo. 

#V2.0
  In Version 2.0, I want to: get my form styling where i want it (especially those drop-downs); finesse the design a bit to look like original vision (css animations, even more minimalist design); add bill totals for each customer; add tax and tip; combo all customers with the same table number into the same check; add a kitchen view + kitchen functionality (show timestamps, mark as completed, change color as ticket ages); and work on the flow a bit. I'd also like to cut down on the number of clicks a server has to make to complete an order - ideally, I'd like to combine the entire process into one or two screens; and incorporate a modal to print a customer's bill. Admin work flow could use some work as well.
