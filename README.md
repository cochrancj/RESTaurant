#User Story

I'm Sally the waitress. As a server, I need to be able to fire this app up on my work phone -
  And be able to:
    Log in
    Create a new order
    Enter the item(s) each customer wants
    View the order, which lists the customer(s), table number, what each customer ordered, and whether they have paid or not
  I also need to be able to submit my order to the kitchen, edit my order, and mark the order as paid when all customers have paid.
